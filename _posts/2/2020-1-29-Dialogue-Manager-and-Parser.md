Lessons learned:</br>
One reason that my walk cycle looks choppy is because I am not keeping the shapes constant sized/volumed. For example, the size of the legs varies between frames. 
If I spend a little longer refining the work, it should look better. It’s ok for platformers. But I don’t think it will look as good as I imagined for rpg.</br>
And I finalized realized the benefit of pixel art, how much time it can save you.</br>
